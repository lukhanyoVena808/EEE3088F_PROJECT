## IoT Hat
The HAT in the our design project is a Light Dependent Resistor and temperature sensor with an onboard FTDI ic chip. Some scenarios in which the HAT will be mostly used include; Fire Detection where light levels and temperature levels will be monitored and alarm system will be triggered if the levels rise to the extreme. It can also be used in weather station for weather forecasting purposes. It can also be used in a Greenhouse as part of control system to control fans and irrigation according to environmental conditions detected by sensor.

The schematics can be found here [Main Design](https://github.com/lukhanyoVena808/EEE3088F_PROJECT/tree/main/Design_Proposal/Main_Design) . The footprints can be found in [Library](https://github.com/lukhanyoVena808/EEE3088F_PROJECT/tree/main/Design_Proposal/Library) and BOM's can be found under each submodule.
